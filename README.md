This is an easy project that can help python beginners know how to a simple problem like the one below;
1. Given an integer,n , perform the following conditional actions:

● If n is odd, print Weird
● If n is even and in the inclusive range of 10 to 100 , print Not Weird
● If n is even and in the inclusive range of 101 to 1000 , print Weird
● If n is even and greater than 1000 , print Not Weird

2. Develop a function called print_full_name that will take two parameters and print a
formatted greeting.
a. Parameters:
i. first (string): The first name of a person.
ii. last (string): The last name of a person.
b. Output: The function should print the following message: "Hello [first] [last]! You
just delved into python". Where [first] and [last] should be replaced with the actual
values of the parameters.
